# OLYMPUS

Welcome to the OLYMPUS project! This is something Fulminata has been working on all season, in order to allow our robot to align to poles and cones in autonomous. OLYMPUS is a software suite that consists of 5 parts:
# JANUS
Janus is the Greek god with two faces, one on each side of his head. Just like Janus, our robot has two cameras, one on each side of the robot. Therefore, our pole detection pipeline is called Janus
# APOLLO
Apollo is the Greek god of archery, and because our cameras aim toward their targets to see them better, it's just like our robot is shooting an arrow at its target!
# ARTEMIS
Artemis is the sister of Apollo, and is also an archery god. Aretemis' job is to localize the robot, based on where it sees the pole or cone stack
# MERCURY
Mercury is the messenger god, and wears winged shoes to make him faster. Our algorithm that moves our robot to poles and cones is super fast, and is called Mercury.
# HEPHAESTUS
Hephaestus is the name of our RoadRunner algorithms, wich move our robot to a scoring position, right before the rest of OLYMPUS kicks in.
